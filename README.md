## Introduction

My name is Lateef Adeyekun. I am a self-taught backend developer currently 
transitioning to full-stack web development. I have experience in designing 
new features from the conceptual stage to production, implementing wireframes 
and design flows into high-performance and efficient web applications, and 
writing reusable and scalable code.

I have previously worked with backend programming languages such as PHP, 
Java, and Servlets, as well as database systems including MySQL, MSSQL, 
and Sybase, and front-end libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap.

When I am not coding, you will definitely find me watching soccer or hanging 
out with friends and families.
